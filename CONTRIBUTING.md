# Contributing Guidelines

### Rules for theme layouts:
- If possible, ONLY edit the `tailwind.config.js` file for *basic themes.* If your theme is more advanced, feel free to edit more files.
- Please use the existing file structure. Check out the 'example-layout' folder for a prime example of how things should be laid out.
- Please copy and edit the current README.example when creating a theme.
